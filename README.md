My name is Naude Vlok, and Iâ€™m originally from South Africa. Currently, Iâ€™m studying in the United States, balancing a busy schedule of classes, work, and fitness. I have a strong interest in programming and have been working on improving my skills, particularly in Java, where Iâ€™ve developed projects like an invoice calculator while focusing on writing clean and well-documented code.

Outside of academics, Iâ€™ve been dedicated to fitness, aiming to lose weight and build strength while managing knee issues. I train regularly, incorporating weightlifting and rugby into my routine.

Lately, Iâ€™ve also been exploring finance, specifically day trading and long-term investing. Iâ€™ve committed to learning about market strategies and analysis, dedicating at least an hour a day to studying trading concepts.

Balancing all these aspectsâ€”school, work, fitness, and investingâ€”has been challenging, but I enjoy the process of self-improvement and structured growth.
